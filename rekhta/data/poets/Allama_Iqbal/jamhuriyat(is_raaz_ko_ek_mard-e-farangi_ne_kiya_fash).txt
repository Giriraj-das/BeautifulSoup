is raaz ko ik mard-e-farañgī ne kiyā faash
har-chand ki daanā ise kholā nahīñ karte
jamhūriyat ik tarz-e-hukūmat hai ki jis meñ
bandoñ ko ginā karte haiñ taulā nahīñ karte
Democracy
One myth, at least, the feringhee exploded,
A secret wise men have never betrayed:
Democracy is a form of government in which
Heads are counted, but men never weighed.
