biis baras se khaḌe the jo is gaatī nahr ke dvaar

ghane suhāne chhāñv chhiḌakte bor lade chhatnār
biis hazār meñ bik ga.e saare hare bhare ashjār

jin kī saañs kā har jhoñkā thā ek ajiib tilism
qātil teshe chiir ga.e un sāvantoñ ke jism
They who have stood at the gate of this singing stream for twenty years
Elegant sentinels at the borders of rolling fields
Agreeably dark, shade-sprinkling, fruit laden, tall
For twenty thousand were sold away all the verdurous trees
They whose every gusty breath was strange magic
Murderous axes came and split the bodies of those heroes
Down with a thud fell the blue wall of wounded trees
Huge bodies being sawn, falling skeletons, leaf and fruit being cut away
Heaps of dead bodies in the pale shroud of trembling sunlight
Today standing beside the gate of this singing stream I think
In this shambles my thought is the only flowering branch
Now, O children of Adam, a mortal blow for me too.

girī dhaḌām se ghāyal peḌoñ kī niilī dīvār
kaTte haikal jhaḌte pinjar chhaTte barg-o-bār
sahī dhuup ke zard kafan meñ lāshoñ ke ambār

aaj khaḌā maiñ sochtā huuñ is gaatī nahr ke dvaar
is maqtal meñ sirf ik merī soch lahaktī Daal
mujh par bhī ab kaarī zarb ik ai aadam kī aal
