THE LAST MAN'S VAUNT
Now the companions of the king are satisfied—the
severed heads and arms of those who would not bow
their head, hang from the battlements
On every side is peace
Peace, perfect peace.
The people's cry cannot be heard-a victim to the
trumpets' blare
Men's stock of patience is all spent-lost in the lunacy
of prayer
All hope of recompense is gone - men do not trust in God's
reward
Words have no credibility, respect for human life is gone
Peace, perfect peace.
Now the companions of the king are satisfied: the severed
heads and arms of those who would not bow their head,
hang from the battlements
On every side is peace
Peace, perfect peace.
The moat of power's fort is full-filled with the corpses
of the dead
The victors have shared out the plunder looted from the
commonwealth
The cords of the pavilion of tongue and word have all been cut
Peace, perfect peace.
Now the companions of the king are satisfied: the severed
heads and arms of those who would not bow their head,
hang from the battlements
On every side is peace
Peace, perfect peace.
