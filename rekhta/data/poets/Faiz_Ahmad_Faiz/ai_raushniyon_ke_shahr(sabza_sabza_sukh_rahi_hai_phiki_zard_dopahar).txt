sabza sabza suukh rahī hai phīkī zard dopahar
dīvāroñ ko chaaT rahā hai tanhā.ī kā zahr
duur ufuq tak ghaTtī baḌhtī uThtī rahtī hai
kohr kī sūrat be-raunaq dardoñ kī gadlī lahr
bastā hai is kohr ke pīchhe raushniyoñ kā shahr

ai raushniyoñ ke shahr

kaun kahe kis samt hai terī raushniyoñ kī raah
har jānib be-nūr khaḌī hai hijr kī shahr-panāh
thak kar har sū baiTh rahī hai shauq kī maand sipāh

aaj mirā dil fikr meñ hai
ai raushniyoñ ke shahr
shab-ḳhūñ se muñh pher na jaa.e armānoñ kī rau
ḳhair ho terī lailāoñ kī un sab se kah do
aaj kī shab jab diye jalā.eñ ūñchī rakkheñ lau
City of Lights

On each patch of green, from one shade to the next,
the noon is erasing itself by wiping out all color,
becoming pale, desolation everywhere,
the poison of exile painted on the walls.
In the distance,
there are terrible sorrows, like tides:
they draw back, swell, become full, subside.
They've turned the horizon to mist.
And behind that mist is the city of lights,
my city of many lights.

How will I return to you, my city,
where is the road to your lights? My hopes
are in retreat, exhausted by these unlit, broken walls,
and my heart, their leader, is in terrible doubt.

But let all be well, my city, if under
cover of darkness, in a final attack,
my heart leads its reserves of longings
and storms you tonight. Just tell all your lovers
to turn the wicks of their lamps high
so that I may find you, Oh city,
my city of many lights.
