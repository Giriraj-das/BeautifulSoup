Paris
The day faded away, and down the streets
and alleyways
were arrayed pallid lampposts
from whose bowls rained down
this crowded city's frustrations.
Over there
the vestiges of past glory
began to look hazy against the skyline
and there, in front of the eye,
some shadow embraced a wall's shadow
cherishing the faint hope for another shadow—
an everyday occurrence—
prefaces a mute comment
on the harshness of time;
and some stranger
skirting these lights, these shadow,
presses on towards his dreamless bed-chamber.
