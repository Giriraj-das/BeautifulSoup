ham kyā karte kis rah chalte
har raah meñ kāñTe bikhre the
in rishtoñ ke jo chhūT ga.e
in sadiyoñ ke yāranoñ ke
jo ik ik kar ke TuuT ga.e
jis raah chale jis samt ga.e
yuuñ paañv lahūluhān hue
sab dekhne vaale kahte the
ye kaisī riit rachā.ī hai
ye mehñdī kyuuñ lagā.ī hai
vo kahte the kyuuñ qaht-e-vafā
kā nāhaq charchā karte ho
paañv se lahū ko dho Dālo!
ye rāheñ jab aT jā.eñgī
sau raste in se phūTeñge
tum dil ko sambhālo jis meñ abhī
sau tarah ke nashtar TūTeñge

Wash the Blood Off Your Feet
What could we do—where could we go?
Thorns were strewn in every pathway.
Those bonds, now sundered—
those friendships of centuries
broken, one by one;
whichever way we went, in whatever direction,
the feet were bathed in blood.

Said all those who saw:
what rite is this,
why these hennaed feet?
Said they: why this futile talk
about the drought of loyalty?

Wash the blood off your feet!
When these pathways will be closed,
a hundred new routes will branch out.
You had better hold your heart
in which a hundred different lancets will break.
