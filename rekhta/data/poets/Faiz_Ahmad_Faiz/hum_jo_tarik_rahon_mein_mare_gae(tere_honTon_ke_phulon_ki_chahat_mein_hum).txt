tere hoñToñ ke phūloñ kī chāhat meñ ham
daar kī ḳhushk Tahnī pe vaare ga.e
tere hātoñ kī sham.oñ kī hasrat meñ ham
nīm-tārīk rāhoñ meñ maare ga.e

sūliyoñ par hamāre laboñ se pare
tere hoñToñ kī laalī lapaktī rahī
terī zulfoñ kī mastī barastī rahī
tere hāthoñ kī chāñdī damaktī rahī

jab ghulī terī rāhoñ meñ shām-e-sitam
ham chale aa.e laa.e jahāñ tak qadam
lab pe harf-e-ġhazal dil meñ qindīl-e-ġham
apnā ġham thā gavāhī tire husn kī
dekh qaa.em rahe is gavāhī pe ham
ham jo tārīk rāhoñ pe maare ga.e

nā-rasā.ī agar apnī taqdīr thī
terī ulfat to apnī hī tadbīr thī
kis ko shikva hai gar shauq ke silsile
hijr kī qatl-gāhoñ se sab jā mile

qatl-gāhoñ se chun kar hamāre alam
aur nikleñge ushshāq ke qāfile
jin kī rāh-e-talab se hamāre qadam
muḳhtasar kar chale dard ke fāsle
kar chale jin kī ḳhātir jahāñgīr ham
jaañ gañvā kar tirī dilbarī kā bharam
ham jo tārīk rāhoñ meñ maare ga.e
We who were Executed

I longed for your lips, dreamed of their roses:
I was hanged from the dry branch of the scaffold.
I wanted to touch your hands, their silver light:
I was murdered in the half-light of dim lanes.

And there where you were crucified,
so far away from my words,
you still were beautiful:
color kept clinging to your lips
rapture was still vivid in your hair-
light remained silvering in your hands.

When the night of cruelty merged with the roads you had taken,
I came as far as my feet could bring me,
on my lips the phrase of a song,
my heart lit up only by sorrow.
This sorrow was my testimony to your beauty-
Look! I remained a witness till the end,
I who was killed in the darkest lanes.

It's true that not to reach you was fate
but who'll deny that to love you
was entirely in my hands?
So why complain if these matters of desire
brought me inevitably to the execution grounds?
