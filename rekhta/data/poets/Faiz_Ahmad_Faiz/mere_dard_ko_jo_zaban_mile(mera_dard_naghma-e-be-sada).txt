mirā dard naġhma-e-be-sadā
mirī zaat zarā-e-be-nishāñ
mere dard ko jo zabāñ mile
mujhe apnā nām-o-nishāñ mile
merī zaat kā jo nishāñ mile
mujhe rāz-e-nazm-e-jahāñ mile
jo mujhe ye rāz-e-nihāñ mile
mirī ḳhāmushī ko bayāñ mile
mujhe kā.enāt kī sarvarī
mujhe daulat-e-do-jahāñ mile
If Pain Could Speak
My pain, a voiceless song,
my being a nameless mote.
If only my pain could speak,
I'd know who I am.
And if my self could find its essence,
I’d unravel the mystery of this world.
If I could seize this hidden mystery,
my silence would find expression.
Then would I lord it over the universe,
possess all treasures of the two worlds.
