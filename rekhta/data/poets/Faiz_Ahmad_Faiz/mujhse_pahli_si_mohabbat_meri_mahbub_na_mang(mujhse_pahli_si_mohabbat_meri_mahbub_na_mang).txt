mujh se pahlī sī mohabbat mirī mahbūb na maañg
maiñ ne samjhā thā ki tū hai to daraḳhshāñ hai hayāt
terā ġham hai to ġham-e-dahr kā jhagḌā kyā hai
terī sūrat se hai aalam meñ bahāroñ ko sabāt
terī āñkhoñ ke sivā duniyā meñ rakkhā kyā hai
tū jo mil jaa.e to taqdīr nigūñ ho jaa.e
yuuñ na thā maiñ ne faqat chāhā thā yuuñ ho jaa.e
aur bhī dukh haiñ zamāne meñ mohabbat ke sivā
rāhateñ aur bhī haiñ vasl kī rāhat ke sivā

an-ginat sadiyoñ ke tārīk bahīmāna tilism
resham o atlas o kamḳhāb meñ bunvā.e hue
jā-ba-jā bikte hue kūcha-o-bāzār meñ jism
ḳhaak meñ luThḌe hue ḳhuun meñ nahlā.e hue

jism nikle hue amrāz ke tannūroñ se
piip bahtī huī galte hue nāsūroñ se
lauT jaatī hai udhar ko bhī nazar kyā kiije
ab bhī dilkash hai tirā husn magar kyā kiije

aur bhī dukh haiñ zamāne meñ mohabbat ke sivā
rāhateñ aur bhī haiñ vasl kī rāhat ke sivā
mujh se pahlī sī mohabbat mirī mahbūb na maañg
Do Not Ask of Me, My Love

Do not ask of me, my love,
that love  I once had for you.
There was a time when
life was bright and young and blooming,
and your sorrow was much more than
any other pain.
Your beauty gave the spring everlasting youth;
your eyes, yes your eyes were everything,
all else was vain.
While you were mine, I thought, the word was mine.
Though now I know that it was not reality,
that's the way I imagined it to be;
for there are other sorrow in the world than love,
and other pleasures, too.
Woven in silk and stain and brocade,
those dark and brutal curses of countless centuries:
bodies bathed in blood, smeared with dust,
sold from market-place to market-place,
bodies risen from the cauldron of disease
pus dripping from their festering sores-
my eyes must also turn to these,
You're beautiful still, my love
but I am helpless too;
for there are other sorrow in the world than love,
and other pleasures too.
Do not ask of me, my love,
the love I once had for you!
