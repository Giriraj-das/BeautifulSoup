nā-gahāñ aaj mire tār-e-nazar se kaT kar
TukḌe TukḌe hue āfāq pe ḳhurshīd o qamar
ab kisī samt añdherā na ujālā hogā
bujh ga.ī dil kī tarah rāh-e-vafā mere baad
dosto qāfila-e-dard kā ab kyā hogā
ab koī aur kare parvarish-e-gulshan-e-ġham
dosto ḳhatm huī dīda-e-tar kī shabnam
tham gayā shor-e-junūñ ḳhatm huī bārish-e-sañg
ḳhāk-e-rah aaj liye hai lab-e-dildār kā rañg
kū-e-jānāñ meñ khulā mere lahū kā parcham
dekhiye dete haiñ kis kis ko sadā mere baad
'kaun hotā hai harīf-e-mai-e-mard-afgan-e-ishq'
'hai mukarrar lab-e-sāqī pe salā mere baad'

End of the Rain of Stones

Suddenly, today, sundered from my vision's thread,
lay splintered in the sky the sun and the moon.
Now there'll be no light or darkness anywhere.
Extinguished, after me, like the heart, is the path of
commitment—
friends, how will it now fare with the caravan of pain?

Let somebody else now nurture the garden of sorrow;
friends, now has dried up the dew of the grieving eye,
now stalled frenzy's uproar, the rain of stones.
Today the pathway's dust carries the tint of the
beloved's lips,
and there stands unfurled, in her lane, the banner of
my blood.
Let's see which ones will be called out after I'm gone—
Let's see who stands up to the fatal intoxication
of love,
for I still hear, from the cupbearer, the call for another
round after I'm gone.
