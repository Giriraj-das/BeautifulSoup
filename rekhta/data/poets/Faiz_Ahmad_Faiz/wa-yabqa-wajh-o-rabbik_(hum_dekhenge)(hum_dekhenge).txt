ham dekheñge
lāzim hai ki ham bhī dekheñge
vo din ki jis kā va.ada hai
jo lauh-e-azal meñ likhkhā hai
jab zulm-o-sitam ke koh-e-girāñ
ruuī kī tarah uḌ jā.eñge
ham mahkūmoñ ke pāñv-tale
jab dhartī dhaḌ-dhaḌ dhaḌkegī
aur ahl-e-hakam ke sar-ūpar

jab bijlī kaḌ-kaḌ kaḌkegī
jab arz-e-ḳhudā ke ka.abe se
sab but uThvā.e jā.eñge
ham ahl-e-safā mardūd-e-haram
masnad pe biThā.e jā.eñge
sab taaj uchhāle jā.eñge
sab taḳht girā.e jā.eñge
bas naam rahegā allāh kā
jo ġhā.eb bhī hai hāzir bhī
jo manzar bhī hai nāzir bhī
uTThegā anal-haq kā na.ara
jo maiñ bhī huuñ aur tum bhī ho

aur raaj karegī ḳhalq-e-ḳhudā
jo maiñ bhī huuñ aur tum bhī ho
Calls to Arms
We will see!
We are also duty-bound to see!
What happens on the day of promise,
Written on tablets of history
We will see!

When massive mountains of cruelty and tyranny
Will be blown sky-high like fluffs of cotton;
When marching steps of the downtrodden
Will make the earth beneath their feet quake and shudder
When skies above the heads of tyrant rulers
By streaks of lighting are split asunder
We will see!
when from the sacred square of the Kaaba
Idols of false Gods will be uprooted:
When to us rootless and unwanted
Seats of power will be granted.
All crowns will be tossed into the air
All thrones ground to dust
We will see!

Only the name of Allah will prevail
Allah who is invisible and yet omnipresent,
Who is the scene and its viewer
Then 'I am the truth' will be the cry
That will rend the sky,
Which includes both you and I!
