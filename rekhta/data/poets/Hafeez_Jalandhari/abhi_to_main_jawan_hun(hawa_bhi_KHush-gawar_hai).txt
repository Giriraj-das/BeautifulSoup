The fragrance wafts o’er the dew
As flowers bloom, in every hue
A thousand melodies fill the air
As spring is here, in bridal wear
It’s time for cheer, bring out the wine
Come back, the moment is divine
Come fill the cup, don’t turn away
Do not demur, do not delay
Do cast your eye upon the spring
The scene’s a dream upon a wing
As evening falls, dark clouds appear
Across the skies, from far and near
Wine lovers will always have their say
As to the taverns, they wend their way
Off with the skeptic look, my man
For I’m not naïve, nor weak nor van
Heaven can wait, as can piety
For I’m still young, so let me be
Yes, there’s talk of God, of fear
Of salvation that’s never near
Redemption, and the need to know
The after life, where souls will go
But man of God, do hark my word
Is not your contention absurd
Tell me dear man, hand on heart
Can love and beauty stand apart?
When joy and fragrance fill the air
And lissome beauties, tall and fair
Bewitching smiles, do lie in wait
How can our passions ever abate
Sensuous glances, full of grace
Entice one into their embrace
Guiles of love, and passion’s sway
What mortal man can stay away?
Okay, to cut the story short
Your point of view, your kindly thought
I may agree with, I may see
But I’m still young, so let me be..
To walk along the mountain side
Or trek the streams at eventide
To hear the nightingales in song
And blooming roses, all along
And then to chance upon your love
And see all worries, gloom dissolve
I guess it’s written in our stars
Tears or joy, what shall be ours..
These tales of love, these songs of yore
Are ones we have all heard before
Some speak of youths full of flair
And others may merely be hot air
These skies, these meadows evergreen
Are scenes that no one has ever seen
Bounty in joy, calming in strife
They are the essence of our life
A life that’s short, that’s so finite
And so every breath holds delight
But is the end ever so nigh
No, no, not now, how can I die
I’ve long to go, I’ve much to see
For I’m still young, so let me be..
No bondage, nor freedom shall remain
No rise, no fall, no wax nor wane
No past, no present, no despair
No vows, no promises, no care
Hope and despair, both beguiled
With past and future reconciled
All sense, all logic shall now depart
There’s just the wine, and the heart
Come let the wine flow, let’s rejoice
Oh nightingale, where is your voice
Do sing of joy, draw out our pain
Let just the cup, the ale remain..
Let every voice sing out as one
Drink on, the joy has just begun
A drink, a drink, don’t you see
For I’m still young, so let me be…
